## Modifications

### The original data was modified by:

* Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
* Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
* Useing descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
* Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names.
* Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each    activity and each subject.


## Descriptions

### Identifiers

* Subject - It is the ID of the test subject

### Activity Labels:

* WALKING (value 1): subject was walking when the readings were taken
* WALKING_UPSTAIRS (value 2): subject was walking up a staircase when the readings were taken
* WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS (value 3): subject was walking down a staircase when the readings were taken
* SITTING (value 4): subject was sitting when the readings were taken
* STANDING (value 5): subject was standing when the readings were taken
* LAYING (value 6): subject was laying down when the readings were taken
